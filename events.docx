2016 - Campaign
A follow up to his first 2015 mention about building the wall came during his presidential campaign. It was one of the highlights of his propaganda that played on the sentiments of border security and immigration. 
August 2016 also saw a rise in the number of tweets sent out from President Trump’s handle. This was followed by the first presidential debate in September 2016, a televised event which had a viewership of more than 100 million. 
January 2018 - The “Shitholegate” event
We can see that January 2018, saw a surge in the number of tweets that were sent out from President Trump’s account. This coincides with the “Shitholegate” event wherein  Trump reinforced his identity as a racist by referring to countries like Haiti, El Salvador and African countries. However, the incident was brushed off as “not being racist” by his strategist. 
“It’s not racist,” the strategist said. “There’s a reason why they all want to come here — these places are shitholes. If they were great and we were a shithole, we would want to go there. Trump says something stupid, two camps erupt, rinse and repeat.”
